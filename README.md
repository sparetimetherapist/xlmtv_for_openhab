Install and set-up xmltv to work with openHAB

This is just a simple install & configuration tool for xmltv -preconfigured for EU-channels- which is needed to import EPG-informations
into openHAB. Afterwards you have to create some files manually in your OH environment (see the examples in this repo):

  - epg.rules
  - epg.items
  - epg.sitemap
  - epg.map
